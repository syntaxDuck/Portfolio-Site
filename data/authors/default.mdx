Hi, I'm Kameron Comer! I'm a simple guy that likes to tinker with things. I graduated from Grand Valley State Univeristy with a BSE in electrical engineering and a minor in mathamatics. 

During my studies in university I took quite a liking to the computer science/engineeering fields. Yet anther outlet for my curiousity! Since then I have been slowly familurizing 
myself with many of the subjects that would otherwise be found in any regular university cariculum.

Much of my insperation to start this blog/protfolio site was to simply have a place to catalog my studies. While I still have a long way to go, I'm eager to learn and love to solve problems,
so I hope you find some enjoyment/interest in my efforst.

All things concidered, welcome to my site!
